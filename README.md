This is my first application. You can access the app at: https://assignment1-demoapp.appspot.com/

How to use the app:
1. Click on the URL to open the app page
2. Enter a number at the end of the url (preferably a smaller number (between 1-15))
3. This should reveal a triangle with as many rows as the input
